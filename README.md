# Hubbub: Messaging Hub #
Hubbub is under heavy development.  Until we have more working software, I doubt you will find much information about it.

## Coding Standards ##
  * I use tabs.  You are free to change my tabs to spaces with any decent editor.
  * If you submit code, I don't care if it's spaces, because if you have a decent editor, it's a 1 second fix to convert back to tabs.
  * I do not use camel case for methods.  I originally tried to adhere to php-fig standards but some are very arbitrary and some ridiculous (but, some good).

## License ##
Please see LICENSE.txt

Hubbub is currently under a non-free license.  I would like to switch Hubbub to a BSD-style license but closes attribution loophopes for ASP (SaaS), until then, it is officially licensed under the
"I can't find a good license, license" v1.0

It is _planned_ that the license will be a BSD license, but still require attribution for hosted solutions.
