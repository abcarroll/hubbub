# Hubbub: Messaging Hub #
Hubbub is under heavy development.  Until we have more working software, I doubt you will find much information about it.

## Coding Standards ##
  * I use tabs.  You are free to change my tabs to spaces with any decent editor.
  * If you submit code, I don't care if it's spaces, because if you have a decent editor, it's a 1 second fix to convert back to tabs.
  * I do not use camel case for methods.  I originally tried to adhere to php-fig standards but some are very arbitrary and some ridiculous (but, some good).

## License ##
Hubbub is available under a BSD-like license.  Please see LICENSE.txt for full license text.

While you are not legally required to do so, I kindly ask if you make commercial use of my software, even as a service, you just simply link back to the
SourceForge homepage, at http://hubbub.sf.net
